My name is Clark Sims. The goal of my GitHub profile is to keep up with the projects I have worked on in my free time.

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

```{r render, include = FALSE}
devtools::build_readme()
```
